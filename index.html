        <div class="one">While determining the test coverage the test cases should be designed well with maximum
            possibilities
            of finding the errors or bugs. The test cases should be very effective. This objective can be measured
            by the number of defects reported per test cases. Higher the number of the defects reported the more
            effective are the test cases.</div>
        <div class="two">Software testing makes sure that the testing is being done properly and hence the system is
            ready for
            use. Good coverage means that the testing has been done to cover the various areas like functionality of
            the application, compatibility of the application with the OS, hardware and different types of browsers,
            performance testing to test the performance of the application and load testing to make sure that the
            system is reliable and should not crash or there should not be any blocking issues. It also determines
            that the application can be deployed easily to the machine and without any resistance. Hence the
            application is easy to install, learn and use.</div>
        <div class="three">The work products such as Requirement document, Design, and User Stories should be verified
            before the
            developer picks it up for development. Identifying any ambiguity or contradicting requirements at this
            stage saves considerable development and test time. The static analysis of the code (reviews, walk-thru,
            inspection, etc.) happens before the code integrates/is ready for testing. This idea of testing is known
            as Verification. It is the process of evaluating the product during the development phase of each work
            product.</div>
        <div class="four">This objective reveals the fact that the essential elements of testing should be to fulfill
            the
            customerâ€™s needs. Testers test the product and ensure the implementation of all the specified
            requirements have. Developing all the test cases, regardless of the testing technique ensures
            verification of the functionality for every executed test case. The Tester should also create a
            requirement traceability matrix (RTM), which will ensure the mapping of all the test cases to
            requirements. RTM is an effective way to ensure that test cases have got the right requirement coverage.
